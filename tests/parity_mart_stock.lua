-- Parity test: mart inventories match pokered, and every item the route
-- driver tries to buy is actually on that mart's shelf.
--
-- Two failures in one, and the second is the one that bit.
--
-- Our extracted mart data was right all along -- VermilionMartClerkText is
-- POKE_BALL, SUPER_POTION, ICE_HEAL, AWAKENING, PARLYZ_HEAL, REPEL
-- (data/items/marts.asm:17), and that is exactly what we import. The route
-- driver's shopping list asked for plain POTION there, which Vermilion has
-- never sold. buyItem logged "shop: no POTION @ VERMILION_MART" into the
-- end-of-run summary and returned, so the bot left town with no healing at
-- all and then died nine times in Surge's gym and five more around
-- Cerulean, every fight taken at whatever HP the last nurse had left it.
--
-- A shopping list that names an unstocked item cannot work, and nothing
-- else in the run reports it loudly enough to notice. This asserts the
-- lists against the data instead.
--
-- Self-contained; run via `luajit tests/parity_mart_stock.lua`.
