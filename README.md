# G1R Deluxe aka Gen1Recomp

A native LÖVE2D recreation of Poke Red, Blue, Yellow, Gold, Silver, Crystal, FireRed, LeafGreen, Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald.
The engine and map behavior are hand-written Lua; game data and graphics are 
decoded from a ROM supplied by the player.

And before you say, "that's not a recomp", you're wrong. Recomp is an acronym. ***Reverse Engineering Causes Obsessive Mental Problems***

## What this is

G1R Deluxe aka Gen1Recomp is a native LÖVE2D recreation of Pokemon Red, Blue, Yellow, Gold,
Silver, Crystal, FireRed, LeafGreen, Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald. The engine and map behavior are
hand-written Lua, ported from the [pret](https://github.com/pret)
disassemblies & C. Game data, graphics, and audio programs are decoded on first
launch from a ROM you supply.

The project does not include a ROM, emulate the Game Boy, transpile assembly,
or download a disassembly. Your ROM is verified, used during import, and
released from memory. It is never copied into the cache, and later launches
load the private generated cache without asking for it again. Music, sound
effects, and cries are synthesized while the game runs. All eleven games can be
imported side by side. Gen 2 support is still under construction.

## Quick Start

1. Download the build for your platform from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/bryanthaboi/gen1recomp/releases/latest).
2. Launch it. The packaged app contains no ROM and no game data, so the
   launcher will ask for one.
3. Choose your legally obtained `.gb` / `.gbc` / `.gba` file, or drop it onto
   the window. Import takes a few seconds and the game starts automatically.
4. Repeat for any other game you own. Each one gets its own tab in the launcher.

Only the canonical US English ROMs below are accepted. The importer checks the
SHA-1 before creating any game data. FireRed, LeafGreen, Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald support is in beta.

**Platform notes:** [Linux](docs/platforms/linux.md),
[iOS](docs/platforms/ios.md), [Xbox Dev Mode](docs/platforms/xbox.md),
[handhelds](docs/platforms/handhelds.md), and
[Nintendo Switch](docs/platforms/switch.md) each have their own install steps.

**Windows Defender:** it sometimes flags the Windows build with a generic
detection such as `Trojan:Win32/Wacatac!ml` (#621). This is a known false
positive: the exe is the official LÖVE runtime with the game archive appended,
and Defender distrusts unsigned executables with appended data. Every release
publishes `sha256sums.txt` so you can verify your download, and you can check
a flagged file on [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com).

**Low-end devices:** **OPTIONS > PERFORMANCE** scales the optional extras for
weaker hardware (HIGH, BALANCED, LOW, or AUTO, the default). It only changes
presentation; game logic is identical on every tier. Details in
[docs/new-features.md](docs/new-features.md).

## Bugs

Found a bug? A warp dropping you somewhere it shouldn't, a battle doing math
that looks wrong, text in the wrong box, anything that does not match the
original game.
[Open a bug report](https://github.com/bryanthaboi/gen1recomp/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml).
Attach a screenshot if you can. It saves a lot of back and forth, and if you
can't get one, the form asks you to describe what you saw instead.

## Special Thanks

This project would not be possible without [pret](https://github.com/pret) >
the pret band of decompiling maniacs > and their
[pokered](https://github.com/pret/pokered) disassembly.
