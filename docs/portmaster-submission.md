# PortMaster submission

Status: testing candidate; not accepted into the catalogue.
Destination: https://github.com/PortsMaster-MV/PortMaster-MV-New
Current requirements: https://portmaster.games/packaging.html

## Permission

On 6 October 2026, project owner bryanthaboi replied “Explicit permission
granted” to Nexhas's request to permit PortMaster distribution of the proprietary
launcher. The supplied private-message screenshot is retained by the requester;
it is not bundled or published. LICENSE.MD records the narrow distribution
exception. The original attribution and other launcher restrictions remain.

## Build and validate

```sh
python3 scripts/portmaster/package.py --version X.Y.Z --screenshot /absolute/gameplay.png
python3 scripts/portmaster/test_launcher.py
luajit tests/engine/portmaster_managed_update_test.lua
```

Use a clean, committed source revision; SOURCE.txt records that revision and
whether tracked changes were present. X.Y.Z identifies the engine version, not
PortMaster approval. The ZIP is explicitly named `gen1recomp-testing.zip`.
The screenshot must show the actual unmodified base game or main function,
not a mod absent from the package. A desktop capture is presentation evidence,
not ARM device validation. Do not commit ROMs or extracted caches.

Copy `dist/portmaster/ports/gen1recomp/` into `ports/` in a sparse checkout of
PortMaster-MV-New. Run its `python3 tools/build_release.py --do-check` and
`python3 tools/build_release.py --quick-build gen1recomp`.
The repository-built ZIP is preferred for community testing.

## Hardware evidence

- Existing standalone SBC build: Nexhas reports it worked on TrimUI Brick.
- Firmware/version and exact build for that report: not yet recorded.
- Catalogue testing ZIP: Nexhas confirmed it works on TrimUI Brick on
  6 October 2026, after testing the candidate supplied in this chat.
- Tested candidate source: `fce5f08650618846ae35142475441ac65937fd2f`.
- Supplied ZIP SHA-256: `7298d2720cf4701f48d5fd31b5f27d03f1351375730e0d0c11cb47553c3ce519`.
- Firmware/version and individual import/save, exit and suspend checks for the
  catalogue test: not yet specified; the report confirms general operation.
- Discord #testing-n-dev thread: not yet created.

Record build SHA/checksum, firmware/version, device and resolution with each
result. Check cold launch, missing/wrong ROM handling, import, controls,
new game, save/reload, exit shortcut, suspend/resume, offline play, and an
update preserving saves. Test 640x480 and a higher resolution; request help
for AmberELEC, dArkOS/ArkOS, muOS, ROCKNIX (Libmali/Panfrost), and Knulli.
Keep untested cells unchecked. The Brick confirmation applies to the candidate
identified above; it does not establish compatibility with other firmware.

## Testing-thread draft

Title: Gen1Recomp — aarch64 LÖVE port testing

I'm preparing Gen1Recomp for PortMaster-MV. It is a native recreation which
extracts assets from a user-supplied supported US ROM; no ROMs or generated
cache are included. The project owner has explicitly permitted PortMaster
distribution of the launcher, recorded in the included license.

I tested this catalogue candidate on my TrimUI Brick and confirmed it works.
It uses PortMaster's LÖVE 11.5 runtime. I'm looking
for testing on the firmware and resolutions listed above, especially import,
save/reload, controller exit and suspend/resume. Please include device,
firmware, package checksum, result and `gen1recomp/log.txt` when reporting a
problem. Do not upload ROMs, saves, or generated cache in reports.

Attach the validated testing ZIP and its SHA-256. Add the thread URL here once
posted. Submit the upstream PR after community testing, with the source
revision, build instructions, permission note and honest testing matrix.
